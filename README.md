## 🔔 Overview

This script is a replica of the [WordPress.org download counter](https://wordpress.org/download/counter/). I created it just for fun to monitor the plugin download progress on my other monitor. When ever someone downloads the plugin, the counter updates.

The script can be forked and changed to any plugin on the WordPress.org repository.

> _The script is currently set to my [Auto Load Next Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/auto-load-next-post/) plugin._

#### 🔧 Variables

Two variables are all that are required to change for your own plugin download counter.

Plugin slug: `$plugin_slug = 'auto-load-next-post'`

Plugin name: `$plugin_name = 'Auto Load Next Post'`

The plugin slug needs to be changed in both the `index.php` and `dl-counter.php` files.

That's it! 😄

#### ✅ Requirements

To use this script you will need:

* PHP

#### 💽 Installation

1. Download a `.zip` file with the [latest version](https://github.com/seb86/download-counter/releases).
2. Open the files to change the variables for your own plugin and save.
3. Open either your FTP or File Manager to your web host.
4. Locate where you want to have the script under your domain. I put mine under **https://autoloadnextpost.com/download/counter/**
5. Upload the script to your chosen location.

That's it! 😄
